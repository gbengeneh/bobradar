# ConnectWallet Signed Signature Implementation

## Steps to Complete:

1. [x] Modify `src/components/ConnectWallet.tsx` to include signed signature functionality
   - Add import for `enableUnlimitedTransactions` from wallet.ts
   - Call signature function after successful wallet connection
   - Handle signature errors appropriately

2. [ ] Update `src/web3/wallet.ts` to support token transfer signatures
   - Ensure `enableUnlimitedTransactions` can handle token transfers
   - Add proper error handling and logging

3. [ ] Test the implementation
   - Verify wallet connection still works
   - Confirm signature is generated and sent
   - Check for any console errors

## Current Status:
- Application running on http://localhost:3001
- Signature generation functions added to ConnectWallet
- Ready for testing and backend integration
